  This app will launch [RStudio Server] an IDE for [R] on one node of [Redwood] or on a [Bristlecone node].
 
  To start the job promptly, redwood-shared-short account and partition will be added in near future.  

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them.

  <b>NOTE:</b> For technical reasons the RStudio Server currently does not work on Frisco nodes, if you would like to get it working contact us at helpdesk@chpc.utah.edu.
